# Mandarin Tone Classification

# Abstract

Learning tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, requires acquiring correct pronunciation and intonation. This project focuses on developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for the classification of Mandarin tones in audio input. The objective is to aid language learners in improving their tonal accuracy and fluency.
The project involves using the Tone Perfect [1] data set as well as feature extraction techniques, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), to represent the tonal characteristics of the input audio.
The NLP model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network architecture (CNN), optimizing for accuracy in tone classification. The trained model is then applied to real-time audio input data from the user in order to classify their tone.
The potential impact of this project is significant for Mandarin language learners, providing an accessible and interactive tool to enhance their pronunciation skills. By addressing the nuances of tonal variations, the proposed solution aims to accelerate the language learning process and contribute to the broader field of NLP applications for language education. Future work may involve creating a public user-friendly interface for the project, as well as improving the model, with the potential to expand to accommodate regional accents, dialects, and additional features for a more comprehensive language learning experience.
